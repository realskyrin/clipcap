#
# Generate a self-signed code-signing certificate for clipcap.
#
# Why this exists:
#   Signing every build with ONE reusable self-signed certificate gives the app
#   a stable Designated Requirement. This is not a Developer ID cert, so
#   Gatekeeper still shows an "unidentified developer" prompt on first launch.
#
# Run this ONCE, then store the outputs as GitHub Secrets (see bottom). Keep the
# .p12 safe and reuse it forever.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/generate-signing-cert.sh [output_dir]
# Env:
#   CERT_PASSWORD   password protecting the .p12 (default: clipcap)
#   CERT_NAME       certificate common name (default: clipcap Self-Signed)
#   CERT_DAYS       validity in days (default: 3650 — ~10 years)
